This project was my university lab but I desided to move forward and try something new. It was my firs experience with jectpack compose and hell yeah I love it! <br>
Important! This is the most accurate representation of my current architecture approach <br>
It is an imitation of some online store mobile client.

**Platform -** Android <br>
**Language -** Kotlin <br>
**Frameworks & libraries -** Jetpack Compose, LiveData, Material UI, Dagger 2, Coroutines, Retrofit, Room Database, Jsoup, Maps compose <br>
**Architecture -** Clean architecture over MVVM
